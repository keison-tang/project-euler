My solutions to Project Euler problems

https://projecteuler.net/

I'm doing this to:
- Get back into doing technical stuff
- Practice coding style
- Practice problem solving

## Thoughts
- Kinda like a free poor mans leetcode
- All questions revolve around math
- Code is good enough if you can answer the question - basically only 1 test case so there's a chance you might fluke the answer and not account for edge cases

## Process
1. Understand the maths behind the question
2. Come up with an algorithm to solve the question - pen + paper is good for this, go through a scaled down test case
3. Find out how to, and implement it in code. Go to reference docs to look for useful things (in my case stdlibs, boost lib etc)
4. Only look for hints / answer as last resort - when I've tried and still don't know wtf is going on, or when I think I've completely misinterpreted the question 

## Docs
- C++ style guide: https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html
- C++ ref (main one I use): http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/
- Boost lib: https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/
