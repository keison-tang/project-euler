/*
Problem 39: Integer right triangles

If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

a, b, c are integers and > 0

a^2 + b^2 = c^2

Rule 2: A right angled triangle can be isosceles but side c won't be integer. Also to prevent duplicate solutions e.g b^2 + a^2 = c^2
